363,2020-04-27,2020-05-03,"The total vehicle miles traveled (VMT) on all interstate highways for Week 18 (April 27, 2020 to May 3, 2020) decreased by 37% (6.1 billion vehicle miles) compared to the same week in 2019. Passenger vehicle travel decreased by 40%, while truck travel decreased by 15%.","In the long-term future (next 4-18 months), I predict that VMT will eventually return to pre-pandemic levels as the economy recovers and travel restrictions are lifted. However, there may be a shift towards more sustainable and remote modes of transportation, which could impact VMT in the long run.;In the short-term future (next 1-3 months), I predict that VMT will continue to be lower than usual due to the ongoing pandemic and travel restrictions. However, as states start to reopen, VMT may gradually increase."
364,2020-04-20,2020-04-26,"The total vehicle miles traveled (VMT) on all interstate highways for Week 17 (April 20-26, 2020) decreased by 43% (7.1 billion vehicle miles) compared to the same week in 2019. Passenger vehicle travel decreased by 48%, while truck travel decreased by 15%.","In the long term (next 4-18 months), VMT may gradually recover as pandemic restrictions are lifted, and economic activity resumes. However, the rate and extent of recovery will depend on the effectiveness of pandemic mitigation efforts and the subsequent impact on travel behavior.;In the short term (next 1-3 months), VMT is likely to remain depressed as pandemic-related restrictions persist. However, as essential goods transportation continues, truck travel may stabilize or even increase."
365,2020-04-13,2020-04-19,"The total vehicle miles traveled (VMT) on all interstate highways for Week 16 (April 13-19, 2020) decreased by 45% (7.4 billion vehicle miles) compared to the same week in 2019. Passenger vehicle travel decreased by 51%, and truck travel decreased by 16%.","In the long-term future (next 4-18 months), I predict that VMT will gradually recover as the pandemic subsides and travel restrictions are lifted, but it may take some time to return to pre-pandemic levels.;In the short-term future (next 1-3 months), I predict that VMT will continue to be lower than usual due to the ongoing pandemic and related travel restrictions."
366,2020-04-06,2020-04-12,"The vehicle travel on all interstate highways for week 15 (April 6-12, 2020) decreased by 47% (7.8 billion vehicle miles) compared to the same week in 2019, with an estimated 8.7 billion vehicle miles traveled.","In the long-term future (next 4-18 months), vehicle miles traveled on interstate highways may gradually increase as pandemic restrictions are lifted and economic activity resumes, but the rate of recovery is uncertain and dependent on various factors.;In the short-term future (next 1-3 months), vehicle miles traveled on interstate highways are likely to remain lower than usual due to continued pandemic-related restrictions and precautions."
