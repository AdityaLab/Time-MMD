19,2002-01-01,2002-01-31,"January 2002 averaged near normal when precipitation is integrated across the nation, but 11 of the last 30 months have averaged well below normal, while only three averaged well above normal.","The long-term pattern of dryness in the western U.S. and the Southwest may persist, but it is also possible that a shift in the precipitation pattern could bring above-normal precipitation to these regions in the next 4-12 months.;Based on the current pattern, it is likely that the western U.S. and the Southwest will continue to experience below-normal precipitation in the short term (next 1-3 months)."
20,2002-02-01,2002-02-28,"Twelve of the last 30 months have averaged well below normal precipitation, while only three averaged well above normal.","If the current drought pattern continues, it may lead to a prolonged drought event, potentially lasting several months or even years.

The southern Great Lakes and Ohio Valley may also experience persistent drought conditions due to long-term moisture deficits.;In the short term (next 1-3 months), I predict that the drought conditions in the southern Plains and southern Rockies will continue to worsen if above-normal precipitation does not occur. However, the West and central Plains may continue to experience improving drought conditions if precipitation remains above normal."

Very heavy rain fell at the end of an otherwise very dry month across much of Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri. Long-term moisture deficits persisted across parts of the central and northern Plains, Maine, and much of the West.","The historical data suggests that the 1930s and 1950s were characterized by prolonged periods of extensive droughts with little wetness, which may indicate that the current drought conditions could persist for several months or even years. However, it is also possible that the drought conditions may be alleviated by heavy rainfall events in the coming months.;Based on the current dry conditions and long-term moisture deficits, it is likely that the next 1-3 months will continue to be dry, especially in the central and northern Great Plains to western Great Lakes, parts of the West, and a few locations in the southern Plains and along the east coast."

Dry conditions persisted across much of the West, Great Plains, and Upper Midwest to Great Lakes, and parts of the Southeast.","In the long term (next 4-12 months), I predict that the drought conditions may persist or even worsen in certain regions, especially if the current high-pressure system or La Niña-like pattern continues to dominate the climate. However, it's also possible that a shift in the climate pattern could bring above-average precipitation to some areas, leading to drought relief.;Based on the current drought situation and historical patterns, I predict that the next 1-3 months will likely see continued below-average precipitation in the West, Great Plains, and Upper Midwest to Great Lakes, with potential for short-term dry spells in other regions."

43,2004-01-01,2004-01-31,"January 2004 was drier than normal across a significant portion of the western and Great Plains drought areas, as well as from New England down much of the eastern seaboard.","The persistence of long-term moisture deficits in the West and Upper Midwest to southern Plains may lead to a prolonged period of drought in these regions over the next 4-12 months, unless significant precipitation events occur to alleviate these deficits.;Based on the current dry conditions, it is likely that the next 1-3 months will continue to experience below-normal precipitation in the western and Great Plains regions, potentially exacerbating drought conditions."
44,2004-02-01,2004-02-29,"February was wetter than normal across a significant portion of the western and Great Plains drought areas, but dry from New England across much of the mid-Atlantic coast and Ohio Valley.","The historical context of the last two decades being characterized by unusual wetness with short periods of extensive droughts suggests that the contiguous U.S. may experience a prolonged period of wetness in the next 4-12 months. However, the persistence of long-term moisture deficits in some areas may lead to continued drought conditions in these regions.;Based on the recent wetness in the western and Great Plains drought areas, it is possible that these regions may experience above-normal precipitation in the next 1-3 months.

45,2004-03-01,2004-03-31,"March was drier than normal across much of the U.S., especially in the Southeast, where several states had a record or near-record dry month. Long-term moisture deficits (last 9 to 24 to 60 months) persisted across parts of the Upper Midwest to central Plains, parts of the Southeast, and most of the West.","The paleoclimatic perspective suggests that the southwestern U.S. has experienced unusually dry conditions for much of the last four years, which may be a sign of a longer-term drought pattern. This, combined with the current dryness, may indicate a higher likelihood of drought conditions persisting or intensifying over the next 4-12 months.;Based on the current dryness and long-term moisture deficits, it is likely that the next 1-3 months will continue to be drier than normal, especially in the Southeast and West. This may lead to further drought intensification and expansion in these regions."
