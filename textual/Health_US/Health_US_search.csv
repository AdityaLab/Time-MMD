In the United States, flu season typically occurs in the fall and winter, with peak activity between December and February. 
Vaccination against influenza viruses reduces infection.","Predictions you can make for the long-term future (next few months):
The flu season is likely to continue until spring, with a possible decline in cases as the weather warms up. 
Public health officials may need to reassess their strategies for combating the flu and COVID-19, including vaccination campaigns and infection control measures.;Predictions you can make for the short-term future (next 1-4 weeks):
Flu activity is likely to continue to peak in the coming weeks, with a high number of cases reported.

2077,2024-02-26,2024-03-03,The CDC recommends that all persons in the US aged ≥6 months receive annual influenza vaccination.,"As the 2023-24 season comes to a close, it is likely that public health efforts will shift towards preparing for the next influenza season, including the development and distribution of new vaccines and continued monitoring of vaccine effectiveness.;Based on the current data, it is likely that the CDC will continue to recommend influenza vaccination for the remainder of the 2023-24 season, and that vaccine effectiveness will remain a key area of focus."
2078,2024-03-04,2024-03-10,"The United States has reported more than 100 flu-related deaths in children so far this season, with about half associated with influenza A virus infection.","In the long-term, the development of new flu vaccines and treatments, such as those that utilize damage sensing through TLR9, may improve the effectiveness of vaccination efforts and reduce the burden of influenza infections.;In the short-term, the number of flu-related deaths and cases may continue to rise, especially among vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly, if public health interventions are not strengthened."
