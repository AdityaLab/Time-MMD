However, this is speculative and depends on various factors, including weather patterns, vaccination rates, and other environmental factors.;Based on the current trend, it is likely that the proportion of flu patients to the total number of patients in the African region will remain relatively stable or slightly decrease in the next 1-4 weeks."
473,2024-03-18,2024-03-24,"In Epiweek 12, 85 specimens tested positive for influenza virus (positivity of 4.9%), out of 1736 specimens processed.","In the long-term, the proportion of flu patients to the total number of patients in the African region may increase or decrease depending on various factors such as weather patterns, population immunity, and virus mutations. However, based on historical trends, it is likely that the positivity rate will peak in the next 5-12 weeks and then decline.;Based on the current trend, it is likely that the proportion of flu patients to the total number of patients in the African region will remain moderate in the next 1-4 weeks, with a positivity rate between 4-8%."
474,2024-03-11,2024-03-17,"The proportion of flu patients to the total number of patients in the African region for week 11 is 5.6% (73 specimens tested positive for influenza virus out of 1,311 specimens tested).","In the long term (next 5-12 weeks), it is difficult to predict the exact proportion of flu patients, but it is likely that the positivity rate will continue to fluctuate based on various factors such as seasonality, vaccination efforts, and other environmental factors.;Based on the current trend, it is likely that the proportion of flu patients to the total number of patients in the African region will remain around 5-6% in the next 1-4 weeks. However, there may be variations across different transmission zones."
475,2024-03-04,2024-03-10,"The proportion of flu patients to the total number of patients in the African region is 5.2% (86 specimens tested positive for influenza virus out of 1,656 specimens tested).","In the long term (next 5-12 weeks), it is possible that the positivity rate for influenza virus will continue to fluctuate, but it may eventually decrease as the flu season comes to an end.;Based on the current trend, it is likely that the proportion of flu patients to the total number of patients in the African region will continue to decline in the next 1-4 weeks."
476,2024-02-26,2024-03-03,"In Epiweek 9, the regional percent positivity for influenza was 5.9%, with 896 specimens testing positive out of 1,511 specimens tested. The cumulative percent positivity for 2024 was 9%.","In the long term (next 5-12 weeks), the proportion of flu patients to the total number of patients in the African region may decrease as the influenza season comes to an end. However, this depends on various factors, including the effectiveness of public health measures and the emergence of new influenza strains.;Based on the current trend, it is likely that the proportion of flu patients to the total number of patients in the African region will remain moderate to high in the short term (next 1-4 weeks)."
477,2024-02-19,2024-02-25,"In Epiweek 8, 124 specimens tested positive for influenza virus, with a positivity rate of 8.3%.","In the long term (next 5-12 weeks), it is possible that the influenza positivity rates may decline as the season progresses, but continued surveillance is necessary to monitor transmission patterns and adjust public health responses accordingly.;Based on the current trends, it is likely that the proportion of flu patients to the total number of patients in the African region will remain significant over the next 1-4 weeks, with some zones potentially experiencing higher positivity rates than others."
478,2024-02-12,2024-02-18,"The proportion of flu patients to the total number of patients in the African region in week 7 is 9.4% (128 specimens tested positive for influenza virus out of 1,361 specimens tested).","In the long term (next 5-12 weeks), the flu season may peak and then decline, but it is difficult to predict the exact timing and magnitude of the peak.;Based on the current trend, it is likely that the proportion of flu patients to the total number of patients in the African region will remain around 9-10% in the next 1-4 weeks."
479,2024-02-05,2024-02-11,"In Epiweek 6, 112 specimens tested positive for influenza virus (positivity of 6.5%) out of 1,732 specimens tested.","In the long-term future (next 5-12 weeks), it is possible that the positivity rate for influenza will decrease as the season progresses, but continued surveillance is necessary to monitor the situation. 

Note: There is no direct information about the proportion of flu patients to the total number of patients in the African region each week. The provided data is about the positivity rate of influenza specimens tested, which is not directly equivalent to the proportion of flu patients to the total number of patients.;In the short-term future (next 1-4 weeks), it is likely that the positivity rate for influenza will remain relatively high, potentially with some fluctuations across different transmission zones."
480,2024-01-22,2024-01-28,"In Epiweek 4, the regional percent positivity for influenza was 8.1%, and the cumulative percent positivity for 2024 was 11.2%.","In the long term, the influenza positivity rate may decrease as the season progresses, but it is difficult to predict the exact trend. The WHO African region may experience a peak in influenza activity in the next 5-12 weeks, followed by a decline in positivity rates.;Based on the current trend, it is likely that the influenza positivity rate will remain elevated in the short term, with some transmission zones experiencing higher rates than others. The next 1-4 weeks may see continued circulation of Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and Influenza A (H3) subtypes."
481,2024-01-15,2024-01-21,The proportion of flu patients to the total number of patients in the African region for week 3 is 10.6% (184 specimens tested positive for influenza virus out of 1735 specimens tested).,"In the long term (next 5-12 weeks), the influenza season is expected to peak and then decline. However, the co-circulation of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 may lead to a prolonged influenza season or unpredictable patterns of transmission.;Based on the current trend, it is likely that the proportion of flu patients to the total number of patients in the African region will continue to increase in the next 1-4 weeks, with possible peaks in specific transmission zones."
