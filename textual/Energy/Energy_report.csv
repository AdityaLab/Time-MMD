347,2024-02-05,2024-02-09,"The national average retail price for regular gasoline rose to $3.192 per gallon on February 12, 2024, $0.056 above last week’s price, and $0.198 less than the year-ago price.","In the long-term, I predict that gasoline prices will stabilize or decrease as the market adjusts to the shift in demand and supply. The decrease in distillate fuel production and inventories may lead to a decrease in prices, offsetting the increase in gasoline production.;In the short-term, I predict that gasoline prices will continue to rise slightly, driven by the increase in refinery inputs and gasoline production. However, the downward pressure from decreasing distillate fuel production and inventories may limit the price increase."
348,2024-01-29,2024-02-02,"The national average retail price for regular gasoline rose to $3.136 per gallon on February 5, 2024, $0.041 above last week’s price, and $0.308 less than the year-ago price. The New York Harbor spot price for conventional gasoline increased to $2.169 per gallon, $0.21 less than a week ago, and $0.288 less than the year-ago price.","In the long-term (next 4-18 months), gasoline prices may stabilize or decrease as refineries adjust to the changes in crude oil imports and production. The decrease in distillate fuel production and inventories may also lead to a decrease in gasoline prices.;In the short-term (next 1-3 months), gasoline prices may continue to rise slightly due to decreased production and increased imports, but the increase is expected to be minimal."
349,2024-01-22,2024-01-26,"The national average retail price for regular gasoline rose to $3.095 per gallon on January 29, 2024, $0.033 above last week’s price, and $0.394 less than the year-ago price.","In the long-term, the trend of increasing gasoline production and decreasing distillate fuel production may lead to a more stable gasoline market, potentially resulting in lower prices. However, this depends on various factors, including crude oil prices, refinery capacity, and demand.;In the short-term, gasoline prices may continue to increase, but at a slow pace, due to the current refinery output and inventory levels."
350,2024-01-15,2024-01-19,"The national average retail price for regular gasoline rose to $3.062 per gallon on January 22, 2024, $0.004 above last week’s price, and $0.353 less than the year-ago price.","In the long term (next 4-18 months), I predict that the retail gasoline prices will likely follow the trend of crude oil prices, which are influenced by global demand and supply factors. If the global economy continues to grow, crude oil prices may increase, leading to higher retail gasoline prices. However, if the economy slows down, crude oil prices may decrease, leading to lower retail gasoline prices.;In the short term (next 1-3 months), I predict that the retail gasoline prices may continue to rise slightly due to the decrease in refinery capacity utilization and crude oil imports, but the increase will be limited by the relatively stable inventory levels."
351,2024-01-08,2024-01-12,"The national average retail price for regular gasoline declined to $3.058 per gallon on January 15, 2024, $0.015 below last week’s price, and $0.252 less than the year-ago price.","In the long term (next 4-18 months), I predict that gasoline prices will increase due to the ongoing trend of increasing demand and the potential for supply disruptions. However, the increase in crude oil imports and the growth of total motor gasoline inventories may mitigate the price increase.;In the short term (next 1-3 months), I predict that gasoline prices will remain stable or decrease slightly due to the decrease in crude oil prices and the increase in total motor gasoline inventories."
352,2024-01-01,2024-01-05,"The national average retail price for regular gasoline declined to $3.073 per gallon on January 8, 2024, $0.016 below last week’s price, and $0.186 less than the year-ago price.","In the long term, gasoline prices may increase as refineries begin to prepare for the summer driving season, which typically leads to an increase in demand. However, this increase may be mitigated by the current surplus in supply and the potential for sustained high refinery utilization rates.;In the short term, gasoline prices are likely to remain stable or decline further due to the current surplus in supply and the decrease in crude oil imports."
353,2023-12-25,2023-12-29,"The national average retail price for regular gasoline fell to $3.089 per gallon on January 1, 2023, $0.027 below last week’s price, and $0.134 less than the price a year ago.","In the long term (next 4-18 months), gasoline prices may increase as crude oil prices continue to rise and refinery capacity utilization remains high, leading to higher production costs and subsequently higher prices at the pump.;Based on the current data, it is likely that gasoline prices will remain relatively stable or experience a slight increase in the short term (next 1-3 months) as refineries continue to operate at high capacity and crude oil imports remain strong."
